# Area of expertise is reporting on sales activity using SQL Server Reporting Service.
I needed to create reports on multi-dimensional attributes of sales activity for the business that I worked for.
The source data for the reporting was a Microsoft SQL database for Microsoft Dynamics NAV ERP software.
A reporting database was created in order to normalize the data.
Reporting dimensions and fact data tables and fields were identified and mapped from the source database to the reporting database.
Microsoft SQL Integration Services was used as the method to transfer data between databases.
Microsoft SQL Analysis Services was used to create a OLAP Reporting Cube.
Finally, Microsoft SQL Reporting Services was used to create the desired sales reports.
